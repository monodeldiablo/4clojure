# My 4clojure.com Solutions

I â™¥ 4clojure. It's quite possibly the best language learning tool ever.

It's so good, in fact, that I've become addicted. My relationships have begun to
suffer. I don't eat or bathe with any regularity. Dark circles ring my puffy,
bloodshot eyes.

And on those precious few days when I can bear to drag myself into work, I find
myself in the clutches of withdrawal, unable to indulge in my one pleasure
whilst I ride that accursed bus. I plunge despairing into a dark and twisted
transit tunnel of despair.

But no longer.

This shall be a versioned, offline repository for 4clojure problems. Sweet,
blissful 4clojure problems...
